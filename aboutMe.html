                    <p>
                        It has been a blessing for me to reach my goal of attending Texas A&M University to study computer 
                        engineering and become a member of the Corps of Cadets. I joined the Corps in August 2019. During 
                        this time, I have learned so much about trust and teamwork as I join with other cadets to reach goals. 
                        This experience has provided me with the skills and leadership experience to work in a team environment 
                        o achieve success.

                    <p>As a Texas A&M Orientation Leader, I worked with a group of twenty student leaders and four supervisors. During 
                        these three months of working, I learned to think and work as a team member, and to adapt quickly by 
                        solving problems as a team of leaders first, and then reporting to our supervisors with a solution. 
                        As an individual working one-on-one with new students, I learned to be patient, attentive, and to really 
                        listen to their questions in order to ensure their smooth transition to Texas A&M University. </p>

                    <p>During this event, we had 24 hours to work together planning out ideas, looking for resources, 
                        coding, and then presenting our project. We made mistakes, but learned so much from them and 
                        gained experience.  We also had fun working together and learning about our shared interests, 
                        our differences and growing in knowledge together!

                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/squadron6" style="color: maroon"><li>Community Service Coordinator</li></a>
                    <p>Since August 2020, I have been Squadron 6 Community Service Sergeant in the Corps of Cadets. 
                        I plan events for 50 cadets, connect the outfit with other organizations, and make sure events 
                        run smoothly.  My first event was cleaning up William Fitch Highway, and it could have gone better 
                        but I learned so much from that experience! The main takeaway that I learned is that communication 
                        is of utmost importance. After learning from the first event, I sent a detailed list of expectations 
                        and of what to expect to my team before the second event. Since everyone knew exactly what they were 
                        supposed to do, it was a success.  But even more importantly, I gain my outfitâ€™s respect and trust. 
                        Overall, I planned four events for the outfit and even though there were more opportunities to learn 
                        from mistakes, I also learned to take failure as the foundation for improvement.

            <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li style="color: maroon">Goal Achievement</li>
                    <p>I am a very goal-oriented individual and I have found that having a vision board on my table to look at daily 
                        keeps me focused on what is important to me. On it are pictures that represent the long-term dreams 
                        as well as short-term goals that I have set for myself. I have pictures of career fields and jobs 
                        that I want to pursue after graduation, pictures that represent the corporate atmosphere that I 
                        look for in a potential employer, and even specific companies that I would love to work for.  
                        The pictures of my short-term goals include personal goals and college achievements that I want 
                        to do before finishing school. Life is short; therefore, I want to use my time wisely and to enjoy my 
                        life.  Trying new things and challenging myself are what really bring me joy and satisfaction.

                <li style="color: maroon">Resposibility</li>
                    <p>One of my dreams is to help people and to bring beauty to life through technology. 
                        With God-given gifts comes the responsibility to keep developing those gifts through 
                        the hard times as well as the easy. I have been blessed by God to have many mentors 
                        placed in my life who guide me throughout my journey as well as the love and support 
                        from my family. The future is exciting as I learn and gain more experience in computer 
                        engineering and I look forward to using the knowledge I am gaining here at college.
