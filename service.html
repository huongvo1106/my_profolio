                <h3 class="col-md-5" style="font-size: 20px;">RSB is a non-profit organization helping seniors with Parkison’s Disease.<br>
                    The purpose of this organization’s project was to renovate an old and dusty building 
                    into a gym for Parkinson’s patients to exercise, practice muscle movements, and socialize 
                    with others who suffer from the disorder.
                    <br>In March, I led a group of 30 students to the RSB Gym to volunteer our services. While there, we vacuumed the rooms and loaded heavy supplies into the building. We cleaned all the walls, took down old stickers, and then painted the walls from black to maroon.

                <h3 class="col-md-5" style="font-size: 20px;">Bella Buddies is a nonprofit organization that trains puppies 
                    to become service dogs for military personnel. People who have served in the military can even spend 
                    the night in building hubs and play with the puppies for free.

                    Last November, I led a group of 40 students to Buffalo, Texas where the purpose of the project was 
                    to help complete the building hubs and to clean up the land.  While there, we trimmed branches, 
                    cleaned up fences, loaded heavy furniture into the hubs, cleaned up dog poop, and loved on and 
                    played with the puppies.
